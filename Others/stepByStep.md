### Detailed Survey Note: Step-by-Step Guide for Setting Up AWS Authentication System (Step One)

This comprehensive guide outlines the process for setting up step one of the authentication system in AWS, specifically focusing on migrating the JWT system to AWS ECS with DocumentDB and configuring AWS Secrets Manager and SES. This step is foundational for an enterprise chatbot platform, ensuring secure and scalable user authentication. The information is derived from provided attachments, including Overview.md, technicalDoc.md, and timeline.md, which detail the technical requirements and dependencies.

#### Background and Context

The authentication system is identified as the first step in the development process, with all subsequent features depending on its functionality. The Overview.md attachment specifies that step one involves "Migrate JWT system to AWS ECS with DocumentDB; configure Secrets Manager, SES," indicating a shift from an existing system (likely using TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB) to a cloud-native AWS environment. The timeline.md attachment reinforces that this step has no prior technical dependencies, making it critical to complete first to avoid delays in the project timeline. It is estimated to take 2.5 to 4 weeks, depending on team experience and AWS environment readiness.

#### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- An existing JWT authentication system (e.g., with login, registration, and token issuance).
- An AWS account with appropriate permissions for ECS, DocumentDB, Secrets Manager, and SES.
- Basic knowledge of Docker, Node.js, and AWS services.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform (optional but recommended).

#### Step-by-Step Process

##### 1. Prepare the JWT Authentication Code for Containerization

The technicalDoc.md attachment provides detailed steps for containerizing the authentication code:

- **Refactor the Code:** Ensure the JWT system is modular and compatible with a containerized environment. Update dependencies, such as using `aws-sdk` for AWS interactions.
- **Create a Dockerfile:** Write a Dockerfile for your authentication service. An example is provided:

  ```Dockerfile
  FROM node:16

  WORKDIR /app
  COPY package*.json ./
  RUN npm install
  COPY . .

  ENV NODE_ENV=production
  CMD ["npm", "start"]
  ```

- **Test Locally:** Build and test the Docker image locally to ensure JWT logic works. Use `docker build -t jwt-auth-service .` and run it to verify functionality.
- **Update Database Configuration:** Replace MongoDB connections with Amazon DocumentDB. Update the connection string to use DocumentDB, e.g.:

  ```
  mongodb://<username>:<password>@<cluster-endpoint>:27017/?ssl=true&replicaSet=rs0&readPreference=secondaryPreferred&retryWrites=false
  ```

This step ensures your application is ready for deployment on AWS ECS.

##### 2. Set Up AWS ECS and DocumentDB

The technicalDoc.md attachment details the infrastructure setup:

- **Create an Amazon DocumentDB Cluster:**
  - Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Amazon DocumentDB.
  - Create a cluster with high availability (multi-AZ) and sufficient storage. Note the cluster endpoint, username, and password.
  - Configure the security group to allow inbound traffic from ECS on port 27017.
- **Set Up AWS ECS:**
  - Navigate to Amazon ECS and create a cluster using Fargate for serverless container management.
  - Define a task definition:
    - Specify the Docker image (to be pushed to Amazon ECR later).
    - Allocate CPU (e.g., 512) and memory (e.g., 1 GB).
    - Configure environment variables or use Secrets Manager for sensitive data.
  - Create an ECS service to run and scale the task, enabling auto-scaling based on CPU/memory utilization.
- **Push Docker Image to Amazon ECR:**
  - Create an ECR repository in AWS.
  - Authenticate Docker to ECR using:

    ```bash
    aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
    ```

  - Tag and push the image:

    ```bash
    docker tag jwt-auth-service:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/jwt-auth-service:latest
    docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/jwt-auth-service:latest
    ```

  - Update the ECS task definition to use this image.

This step ensures your infrastructure is ready to host the containerized authentication service.

##### 3. Configure AWS Secrets Manager

The technicalDoc.md attachment emphasizes securing sensitive data:

- **Store Secrets in Secrets Manager:**
  - Navigate to AWS Secrets Manager and create secrets:
    - For JWT secret: Name `JWT_SECRET`, value `{"JWT_ACCESS_SECRET": "your-jwt-secret-key"}`.
    - For DocumentDB credentials: Name `DOCUMENTDB_CREDENTIALS`, value `{"username": "admin", "password": "your-password"}`.
  - Ensure secrets are encrypted using AWS KMS.
- **Grant ECS Access:**
  - Attach an IAM role to the ECS task with permissions to access Secrets Manager. Example policy:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
          ],
          "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:JWT_SECRET",
            "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:DOCUMENTDB_CREDENTIALS"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

- **Update Application Code:**
  - Use the AWS SDK to retrieve secrets in your Node.js application:

    ```javascript
    const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
    const secretsManager = new AWS.SecretsManager();

    async function getSecret(secretName) {
      const data = await secretsManager.getSecretValue({ SecretId: secretName }).promise();
      return JSON.parse(data.SecretString);
    }

    // Usage
    const jwtSecret = await getSecret('JWT_SECRET');
    const dbCredentials = await getSecret('DOCUMENTDB_CREDENTIALS');
    ```

This step ensures secure storage and retrieval of sensitive data.

##### 4. Configure AWS SES for Email Workflows

The technicalDoc.md attachment mentions workflows like email verification and password reset, requiring SES:

- **Set Up AWS SES:**
  - Navigate to Amazon SES and verify an email address or domain (e.g., `no-reply@yourdomain.com`).
  - Request production access if in sandbox mode.
- **Install SES SDK:**
  - Install `@aws-sdk/client-ses` in your Node.js application:

    ```bash
    npm install @aws-sdk/client-ses
    ```

- **Implement Email Functionality:**
  - Use SES to send emails, such as for password reset:

    ```javascript
    const { SESClient, SendEmailCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-ses');
    const sesClient = new SESClient({ region: '<region>' });

    async function sendPasswordResetEmail(email, token) {
      const command = new SendEmailCommand({
        Source: 'no-reply@yourdomain.com',
        Destination: {
          ToAddresses: [email],
        },
        Message: {
          Subject: {
            Data: 'Password Reset Request',
          },
          Body: {
            Text: {
              Data: `Use this token to reset your password: ${token}`,
            },
          },
        },
      });

      try {
        await sesClient.send(command);
        console.log('Email sent successfully');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error sending email:', error);
      }
    }
    ```

- **Grant SES Permissions:**
  - Ensure the ECS task role has permissions to use SES. Example policy:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "ses:SendEmail",
            "ses:SendRawEmail"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

This step enables email functionalities for user workflows.

##### 5. Test and Deploy

The technicalDoc.md attachment outlines testing and deployment:

- **Deploy the ECS Task and Service:** Deploy your ECS task and service.
- **Test Authentication Endpoints:** Test endpoints like `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` to ensure JWT tokens are issued and verified correctly.
- **Verify Database Connectivity:** Ensure your application can connect to DocumentDB and store/retrieve user data.
- **Test Email Workflows:** Verify that emails (e.g., password reset) are sent successfully via SES.
- **Monitor with CloudWatch:** Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor logs and set alarms for errors.

##### 6. Security and Maintenance

The technicalDoc.md attachment highlights security practices:

- **Rotate Secrets:** Periodically rotate secrets in Secrets Manager as per best practices.
- **Implement Additional Security:** Use HTTPS via CloudFront or ALB in front of ECS. Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints.
- **Backup DocumentDB:** Regularly back up your DocumentDB cluster and test recovery procedures.

#### Dependencies and Timeline

The timeline.md attachment confirms no prior technical dependencies for this step, as it is foundational. All other features (e.g., Database Design, Chatbot Service) rely on authentication being functional. The estimated timeline is 2.5 to 4 weeks, with:

- Infrastructure setup (ECS, DocumentDB, Secrets Manager): 1-2 weeks.
- Workflow implementation and SES integration: 1 week.
- Testing and iteration: 0.5-1 week.

This timeline may vary based on team experience and AWS environment readiness.

#### Security and Compliance Considerations

The technicalDoc.md attachment emphasizes security, such as using HTTPS, encrypting data, and setting up least-privilege IAM roles. Ensure compliance with these standards from the start, as they are critical for the authentication system's integrity.
